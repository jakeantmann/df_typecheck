## ToDo:

https://github.com/cthoyt/cookiecutter-snekpack is inspiration. Might fork when making my cookiecutter

### ~~Initial setup:~~

- ~~Add base code and tests in src layout~~
- ~~Git~~
  - ~~Install git fork~~
  - ~~Create git repo (simple readme, license)~~
  - ~~Make generic .gitignore~~
  - ~~Put on github~~

### ~~Packaging~~

- ~~Turn into package using pyproject.toml and setup.cfg~~

### Code quality part 1: Tox

- Tox
  - ~~pytest~~
  - ~~wemake (linting)~~
  - ~~docstr-coverage (docstring coverage)~~
  - ~~pyroma (package metadata completeness)~~
  - ~~mypy (optional typehint correctness)~~
  - ~~Add py.typed file~~
  - Move metadata to pyproject.toml
  - Fix nitpick issues
  - documentation format and build? (see reference cookiecutter)

### Code quality part 2: CI and pre-commit hooks

- ~~Simple Github Actions (CI)~~
- Pre-commit hooks
- Code coverage (need to research - coveragepy?)

### README

- Add some relevant badges
  - Split tox_gh_actions tests into several kinds of tests (eg pyroma, lint, tests etc.)
  - Add badges to readme
- Update readme 
  - 

### Cookiecutter template

- Personal package template

### Extra stuff

- bumpversion (Version management)
- sphinx (Documentation build)
- PyPi
- Contributing.md
- Code of conduct
- Readme for cookiecutter
